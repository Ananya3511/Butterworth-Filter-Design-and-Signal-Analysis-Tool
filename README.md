# Butterworth Filter Design and Signal Analysis Tool 

This repository contains a MATLAB-based GUI application that simplifies the design and analysis of Butterworth filters while providing an intuitive platform for signal processing tasks.

## Features:

### Filter Design:
Design low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, and band-stop Butterworth filters with user-defined parameters such as cutoff frequency, order, and sampling rate.

### Signal Generation:
Create signals in sine, square, or triangular waveforms with customizable amplitude, frequency, and duration.

### Noise Addition:
Simulate real-world scenarios by introducing various noise levels to the signal.

### Visualization:

  1. Time-domain representation of signals (original, noisy, and filtered).
  2. Frequency-domain analysis with power spectrum visualization.
  3. Overlay comparisons to observe filter effects.

### Interactive GUI:
A user-friendly interface for seamless interaction and real-time updates based on parameter changes.

### Applications:
Ideal for educational demonstrations, research experiments, and practical signal processing use cases.

This tool bridges theoretical concepts and practical implementation, making it a valuable resource for engineers, researchers, and students.
